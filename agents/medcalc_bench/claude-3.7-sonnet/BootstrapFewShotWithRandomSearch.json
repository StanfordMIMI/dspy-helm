        "inputs": "Given a patient note and a clinical question, compute the requested medical value.\n\nPatient note: A male patient aged 5-year-and-1-month was referred for genetic evaluation of development and speech delay, intellectual disabilities at the genetic counselling clinic in Shenzhen Maternal and Child Healthcare Hospital. The parents described that an affected brother also presented the same clinical phenotype but was not available for the clinical examination. The chromosome karyotype and chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) in the proband were normal. The mother was pregnant again and pursued genetic counseling. The proband was subject to comprehensive neurological testing including the Gesell Developmental index. Molecular genetic tests and biochemical and neurochemical analysis were performed on the proband. The present study was approved by the hospital’s Institutional Review Board and written informed consent was obtained from their parents.\nThe proband was the second boy of healthy nonconsanguineous parents (pedigree in Fig. ). He was born at 39 weeks of gestation from an uneventful pregnancy and delivered by Caesarean section (weight, 3600 g; length, 50 cm; head circumference, 36 cm). He showed head control at 12 months, ability to sit by himself at 15 months, and walking with aid at 20 months. His verbal language was nearly absent and he made no visual contact. He suffered from seizures from 6 months old. He had no craniofacial dysmorphism. Gastrointestinal problems such as chronic constipation or nausea were noted in the proband. The physical examination on the proband showed 95 cm height, weight 18.2 kg and developmental and language delay. The proband also had an electroencephalogram (EEG) test, which showed sharp and slow waves in sleep during 24-h EEG monitoring. A brain stem auditory-evoked potential (BAEP) test showed mild abnormality. The proband had a Children’s Autism Rating Scale (CARS) score of 33, which indicated mildly autistic characteristics. The Gesell developmental scale test was used to evaluate the proband. Both the development age (DA) and developmental quotient (DQ) data showed extremely low grades which suggested severe development delay (adaptability, DA = 14.23mo., DQ = 23; gross motor, DA = 26.37mo., DQ = 43; fine movement DA = 15.87mo., DQ = 26; vocabulary DA = 13.07mo., DQ = 21; personal-social skill DA = 13.3mo., DQ = 22). The test results are depicted in Additional file : Figure S1A. The affected brother of the proband (II:1) was not available for the physical examination. The parental description of the clinical phenotype of the brother was mostly the same as the proband. The parents were physically healthy and indicated no significant past medical, surgical or family history.\nDNA samples were provided from the index patient and other family members, which were extracted as previously described []. The present study used the TruSight One Sequencing Panel and NextSeq 500\/550 Mid Output v2 kit (300 cycles) with high depth of coverage for 4813 target genes (approximately 62000 target exons) that are associated with clinically relevant phenotypes. An average sequencing depth of 136.88x was achieved and 98.25% of targeted variants were covered at least to a 10x depth, and 97.04% of targeted variants were covered at least by 20x. The total detected variants numbered 24594, which included 21,733 SNPs, 1,182 insertions and 1,679 deletions respectively. The data were analyzed on the TGex (Translational Genomics Expert) platform featuring with the VarElect scoring system []. A missense mutation, c.1181C > A (p.Thr394Lys), in the SLC6A8 gene was called with high probability as a candidate mutation.\nSanger sequencing was performed to confirm the SLC6A8 gene c.1181C > A mutation (forward primer 5’ ACGGAACTTGTCAGATTGT3’, and reverse primer 5’CAACAGCATGAAGAAGAACA3’). The father (I:1) was wildtype and the mother (I:2) was heterozygous for the c.1181C > A variation. The affected brother (II:1) and the proband (II:2) both carried the hemizygous variation of c.1181C > A. The pregnant mother had an amniocentesis at 22 weeks and Sanger sequencing targeting the SLC6A8 gene c.1181C > A was performed. The result showed a wild-type allele (II:3) and the mother gave birth to a healthy baby girl (Fig. ). In silico variant prediction analysis methods, including SIFT, PolyPhen2, PROVEAN, and Mutation Taster demonstrated this variant had probably damaging or diseasing-causing effects.\nBiochemical screening was performed with blood and urine samples from the proband and his mother. The creatine\/creatinine (Cr:Crn) ratio was determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry with deuterated internal standards in two urine samples taken on different days. A urine creatine test of the proband showed significantly elevated levels of creatine (0.805 mg\/ml, normal control 0.160 ± 0.177 mg\/ml) (Additional file : Figure S1B), and the creatine\/creatinine ratio was significantly elevated compared to controls. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS, Magnetom Skyra 3.0-T, Siemens Healthcare GmbH, Erlangen, Germany), examination using a 3.0-T system at the brain left parietal lobe, right parietal lobe and genu of corpus callosum all showed marked reduction of the brain creatine peak (Fig. left part). Brain MRI showed a thin corpus callosum in the proband (Fig. right part). The MRS and MRI examination of the mother (I:2) showed normal results (Additional file : Figure S1C).\n\nQuestion: What is the patient's body surface area?

        "inputs": "Given a patient note and a clinical question, compute the requested medical value.\n\nPatient note: A 38-year-old pregnant woman [28+1 weeks of twin pregnancy, gravida 3, para 2 (G3P2)] was transferred from a local hospital to our emergency room on March 28, 2018 due to complaints of persistent productive cough, with increased expectoration, dyspnea, dizziness, fatigue, and irregular abdominal pain. The admission diagnoses were as follows:\nsuspected pulmonary infection and heart failure;\nsingle chorionic twin pregnancy;\nmoderate anemia;\npregnancy with severe rachiterata accompanied by a huge dorsal mass; and\nG3P2 28 + 1 weeks of intrauterine pregnancy of twin live fetus.\nThe patient has been suffering from severe congenital scoliosis and kyphosis deformity with a huge dorsal mass, with ulcers repeatedly appearing in the surface of the dorsal mass for more than 10 years. She had a history of 2 deliveries. The first induction in 2008 was an 8-month-old stillbirth. In 2011, she delivered a premature infant who fortunately survived. As she and her husband wanted a male child, they risked another pregnancy.\nThe last menstrual period before the third pregnancy was unknown by the patient, but it was assumed that the patient was approximately 3-months pregnant during the admission. The patient had not had prenatal care since the beginning of pregnancy. She did not have any discomforts during the earlier weeks of pregnancy. However, she started having persistent cough without sputum production on the 24+ weeks of pregnancy, which continued to worsen. She had 2-week treatment in a local hospital prior to her admission in our institution.\nUpon admission, the patient's vital signs were as follows: temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 107 beats per minute (bpm), respiratory rate of 35 breaths per minute, blood pressure of 107\/67 mmHg, and blood oxygen saturation of 92%. Her weight and height were 46 kg and 133 cm, respectively. She was conscious and half-lying on her left side in a decubitus position owing to a huge dorsal mass (Fig. ). Her head was slightly advanced forward. She had a barrel-shaped chest, showing obvious shortening in length. The right shoulder was slightly higher than the left one. The outline of the right chest was larger than that of the left, and the tri-retraction sign was visible upon inhalation. Auscultation of both lungs revealed coarse rales, especially obvious at the lower portion of the right lung. A huge brown soft mass was found covering almost the whole back of the patient, with a size of approximately 26 × 22 × 8 cm and an ulcerative area (10 × 4 cm) at the center. No obvious abnormalities were found in other systems as well as the abdomen and pelvis.\nAt admission, the laboratory examination results were as follows: white blood cell (WBC), 15.9 × 109\/L; neutrophil percentage (N%), 86.3%; hemoglobin concentration (HGB), 76 g\/l; C-reactive protein (CRP), 67.0 mg\/l; and PCT (calcitonin), 11.96 ng\/ml. Mixed bacterium (Streptococcus, a small amount of yeast-like fungus, and Neisseria) were found in the sputum culture.\nThe initial diagnosis of heart failure was excluded because the electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus tachycardia, and the left ventricular ejection fraction was 0.69%, measured by color Doppler echocardiography, which indicated that the diastolic and systolic pressures of the left ventricle were normal. The myocardial marker, B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), was normal as well.\nChest radiographs showed bilateral thoracic asymmetry (Fig. ), spinal protrusion with lateral bending deformity, kyphosis with “S”-type distortion, partial fusion of the left rib, consolidation of the lower portions of both lungs, and bilateral pleural effusion, which may have been caused by the pulmonary infection.\nThe pathogeny of the large dorsal mass could not be identified; however, the possibility of it being either a hemangioma or a neurofibroma cannot be excluded. Nevertheless, Staphylococcus aureus was cultured from the exudate of the local skin rupture.\nB ultrasound showed the following: fetal 1 (left): heart rate: 154 bpm, left occipitoanterior (LOA), biparietal diameter of 6.44 cm, and femur length of 4.76 cm; and fetal 2 (right): heart rate of 148 bpm, right sacrum anterior (RSA), biparietal diameter of 6.41 cm, and femur length of 4.66 cm. Fibrous membrane echoes were found between the twins.\nBefore delivery, we had carried out a series of active symptomatic treatments and intensive monitoring for both the patient and her fetuses. For the mother, we tried to control the lung infection by administering third-generation cephalosporin and transfusing erythrocyte suspension to address her anemia. Daily nursing and treatment of surface ulcers of the dorsal mass were implemented as well. For the fetuses, in addition to fetal electronic monitoring every day, the patient had intramuscular injections of corticosteroid to promote fetal lung maturation.\nTwo weeks later, the patient's condition worsened. She was weak, anorexic, and in a low mood. She was also dyspneic and had persistent cough with thick sputum, which is difficult to expectorate. After multidisciplinary consultation, we decided to induce labor as soon as possible, in consideration of the critical situation of the patient, to ensure safety of the mother and fetuses.\nThe Cook Cervical Ripening Balloon (Fig. A) was used for mechanical dilation of the cervical canal prior to labor induction at term because the cervix was unfavorable for induction. On April 11, 2018 at 14:28 pm, owing to the complete dilation of the cervical, the patient was transferred to the delivery room. Given that she was dyspneic and had spinal deformity accompanied with a huge dorsal mass, she was placed on a right side-lying position while the upper body was elevated 45° to help facilitate the delivery process (Fig. B). At 15:00 pm, transvaginal examination and palpation revealed that fetal 1 had a head presentation, while fetus 2 had breech presentation. Moreover, the foot of fetus 2 was found on the right side of fetus 1's head. Considering that they come from 2 different chorionic cavities, our experienced midwife immediately prepared the patient for delivery. As soon as the rupture of membrane of fetus 1 occurred, the midwife pushed the foot of fetus 2 to the upper right until the foot could not be palpable using her right index and middle fingers, while simultaneously assisting the head of fetus 1 to descend using her ring and little fingers (Fig. C). Fetus 1 was successfully delivered at 16:15 pm, and fetus 2, who had breech presentation, was born at 16:19 pm via transvaginal-assisted delivery (Fig. D and E). The Apgar scores were 6-9-9 for both 2 premature infants. After tracheal intubation, the newborns were transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit immediately (Fig. F and G)\nThe mother's vital signs postpartum were stable. Interestingly, at 24 hours after delivery, the mother's dyspnea and coughing episodes gradually improved. One week later, the patient's temperature was normal, and the uterus contracted well with less vaginal bleeding. Then, she gradually recovered and was discharged soon enough.\nThe 2 neonates survived after treatment and were discharged from the hospital 1 month later.\n\nQuestion: What is the patient's body mass mass index (BMI)? Your answer should be in terms of kg\/m².\n\nAnswer only the requested quantity without units. No explanation needed:",
