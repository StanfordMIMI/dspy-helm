She had presented to the nephrology outpatient department due to edema 9 months earlier. She was diagnosed with T2DM and hypertension 5 years ago and took 4 mg glimepiride, 1000 mg metformin, 50 mg gemigliptin, 15 mg pioglitazone, 5 mg amlodipine, 100 mg losartan, and 25 mg carvedilol. The pioglitazone was withdrawn, while the other medicines were maintained, after the initial visit to our hospital. Her serum creatinine level had been gradually increasing (Fig. ) without significant changes in other laboratory findings. She denied symptoms and signs indicating deterioration of renal function, such as edema, oliguria, fever, chills, general weakness, malaise, arthralgia, myalgia, skin rash, and urine color changes during the 9-month follow-up. She also denied ingestion of known toxins, Chinese herbal medicines, drugs (including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), and nutraceuticals that can affect the serum creatinine level. Her hypertension and serum glucose were well controlled. She was admitted for renal biopsy and management of AKI.\nHer initial vital signs were as follows: blood pressure, 120\/80 mmHg; heart rate, 68 beats\/min; respiratory rate, 18 breaths\/min; and body temperature, 36.5°C. No lymph nodes were palpated on a neck examination. Heart sounds were normal and no wheezing or rales was heard in either lung field. No organomegaly was present in the abdomen, and bowel sounds were audible. No skin color changes on the torso or pitting edema were observed on the legs. Her blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine levels were 29.7 mg\/dL (range: 8.0–20.0 mg\/dL) and 1.45 mg\/dL (range: 0.51–0.95 mg\/dL) on admission, whereas they were 14.1 and 0.53 mg\/dL, respectively, 9 months before admission (Fig. ). The hematocrit and hemoglobin levels were 34% (range: 36%–48%) and 11.4 g\/dL (range: 12–16 g\/dL), respectively. Platelet and red blood cell counts were 232 × 109\/L (normal range: 130–400 × 109\/L) and 3.82 × 1012\/L (normal range: 4.0–5.40 × 1012\/L), respectively. The white blood cell count was 6.76 × 109\/L (normal range: 4.0–10.0 × 109\/L), with 63.5% segmented neutrophils (normal range: 50%–75%), 27.5% lymphocytes (normal range: 20%–44%), 6.7% monocytes (normal range: 50%–75%), and 1.9% eosinophils (normal range: 1.0%–5.0%). Other laboratory test results included sodium, 138 mmol\/L (range: 135–145 mmol\/L); potassium, 4.6 mmol\/L (range: 3.3–5.1 mmol\/L); chloride, 104 mmol\/L (range: 98–110 mmol\/L); glucose, 177 mg\/dL (range: 70–110 mg\/dL); HbA1c, 6.8% (range: 4.2%–5.9%); calcium, 9.0 mg\/dL (range: 8.6–10.2 mg\/dL; phosphorus, 3.9 mg\/dL (range: 2.7–4.5 mg\/dL); and total CO2, 28 mmol\/L (range: 21–31 mmol\/L). The C3 and C4 levels were 129.7 mg\/dL (range: 90–180 mg\/dL) and 34.8 mg\/dL (range: 10–40 mg\/dL), respectively. Urinalysis (dipstick test) revealed no protein or blood, and no red blood cells or white blood cells. The urine albumin creatinine ratio was 14.9 mg\/g (range: 0–20 mg\/g). The thyroid function test was within normal limits, and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies and the anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody were negative.\nKidney ultrasound revealed normal-sized kidneys (right, 10.4 cm; left, 10.4 cm) and echogenicity without evidence of hydronephrosis or nephrolithiasis. A renal biopsy was performed on day 2 of admission. There was edematous interstitium, detachment of tubular epithelial cells, and lymphoplasmacytic infiltration into the interstitium (Fig. A). Tubulitis was indicated by tubular cell detachment and epithelial casts including numerous neutrophils were observed in the lumen of renal tubules and a few eosinophils were also observed among the increased interstitial inflammatory cell infiltrates (Fig. B). However, the glomeruli were normal (Fig. ). After the renal biopsy, we again enquired regarding the consumption of drugs, Chinese herbal medicines, and nutraceuticals that could evoke AIN on day 3 of admission. She disclosed that she had been ingesting an M charantia extract for 7 months to control her T2DM. She took about 600 mg almost every day in liquid form during the first 3 months, and had taken 1200 mg per day during the last 4 months. The M charantia extract was immediately withdrawn and 0.5 mg\/kg\/day of prednisolone was prescribed, and tapered, and then stopped after 3 months. Her serum creatinine decreased to 0.65 mg\/dL after 3 months (Fig. ), while still using the other medicines.\n\nQuestion: What is the patient's delta ratio?\n\nAnswer only the requested quantity without units.

She had complaints of increasing shortness of breath, orthopnoea, fatigue and generalized pruritus. Her complaints also included daytime sleepiness, sudden awakening at night without witnessed apnoea. She had been on haemodialysis three times weekly for 3 years. At admission, she appeared non-distressed, blood pressure was 160\/80 mmHg, heart rate was regular 78 bpm, she was afebrile and had 3\/6 systolic ejection murmur on mitral region. There were diminished breath sounds at the lung bases; she had pedal oedema +\/+ bilaterally. She had 5 kg above her dry weight. Thyroid gland was normally palpable. The urine output was ∼100 ml\/day.\nInitial biochemistry revealed BUN: 117 mg\/dl, Cre: 5.9 mg\/dl, Na: 141 mEq\/l, K: 3.3 mg\/dl, Cl: 83 mEq\/l, albumin: 2.9 g\/dl, TSH: 29.3 mU\/l and free T4: 0.54 pmol\/ dl. On complete blood count, haemoglobin was 9.7 g\/dl, WBC 8700\/mm3 and platelets 160 000\/mm3. Arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis showed pH: 7.637, HCO3: 45 mmol\/l, PaCO2: 43 mmHg, PaO2: 53 mmHg and oxygene saturation: 93%.\nHer medications included insulin glargine, l-thyroxine, quetiapine, sertralin, enalapril, furosemid and bisoprolol.\nThe patient had severe metabolic alkalosis. However, there were no conditions that could lead to metabolic alkalosis, i.e. vomiting, nasogastric suction or alkali administration. On further inquiry, she revealed that she had been taking baking soda occasionally for ∼6 years in order to relieve dyspepsia. During the last month, she increased the amount of ingestion to 4–5 packs per day due to severe dyspeptic complaints. She underwent upper endoscopy for dyspeptic complaints a few months prior to current admission, and the procedure revealed chronic gastritis.\nWe attributed the presence of metabolic alkalosis to oral alkali intake, because she did not have sufficient renal function to excrete excess alkali load. She was not hospitalized previously for any reason at our institution, and routine ABG analysis was not done at her dialysis centre. Thus, we do not exactly know her acid–base status prior to this admission. We performed haemodialysis with a haemodialysis solution whose bicarbonate concentration was 8 mEq\/l below standard bicarbonate value, i.e. 26 mEq\/l. We also monitored ABG values. After three consecutive haemodialysis sessions with this bicarbonate value, subsequent ABG analysis revealed pH: 7.338, HCO3: 19 mmol\/l, PaCO2: 37 mmHg and PaO2: 74 mmHg. l-thyroxine dose was increased to attain euthyroid state. Her presenting symptoms were relieved at follow-up with the normalization of volume status, metabolic alkalosis and hypothyroidism.\n\nQuestion: What is the patient's albumin corrected anion gap in mEq\/L?\n\nAnswer only the requested quantity without units.

A previous suicide had been attempted 10 years before with haloperidol. Her past medical history was negative for cardiac dysrhythmia, hypertensive heart disease or a thyroid dysfunction. The emergency medical service found the patient comatose with response only to deep painful stimuli (Glasgow Coma Scale of 9), normotensive (127\/83 mmHg), hyperglycemic capillary glucose level: 8.96 mmol\/L = 160 mg\/dl and tachycardiac with sinustachycardia of 140 bpm, capillary oxygen saturation was 98% and respiratory rate 12\/min. There was no evidence of trauma or infection. During the transport to the hospital 40 mg of furosemide and 1000 mL saline were administered intravenously for detoxification and prophylaxis of hypotension. Vital signs were stable during transport.\nOn admission on the intensive care unit (ICU) the patient's condition worsened and she was intubated for airway protection. At this time venous blood gas on 30% FiO2 revealed pH of 7.38, pO2 of 45.3 mmHg, pCO2 42.2 mmHg, HCO3\n− 24.4 mmol\/L, base excess −0.1 mmol\/L, Hb 13.8 g\/dl, K+ 3,7 mmol\/L, Na+ 140 mmol\/L.\nTo prevent her from further absorption of quetiapine a gastric lavage was performed (no pill fragments of ingested tablets were recovered) and the patient enterally received 25 g of activated charcoal with 5 g Glauber's salt (sodium sulfate) every 3 to 4 hours until dejection of black stool.\nLaboratory data on admission including serum electrolytes, liver, and renal function parameters and blood count remained normal except glucose of 8.12 mmol\/L (145 mg\/dl), CK of 333 U\/L (control value remained unchanged) with no evidence of myocardial insufficiency or infarction, CRP of 32 mg\/L (control value 8 hours later increased to 76 mg\/L), TSH 6.0 mU\/L (control value 8 hours later increased to 8.56 mU\/L), and leucocytosis with 12.06 (×109\/L).\nThe electrocardiogram at 36 hours postingestion revealed a moderately extended QTc interval measuring 436 millisseconds (at the upper limit of normal) compared to QTc interval of 388 ms after complete recovery. QTc-intervals were calculated using the Bazett formula [].\nA comprehensive drug screen via immunoassay was positive for tricyclic antidepressants and benzodiazepines in particular, although these results could not be confirmed by UV-HPLC-methods.\nOne day after admission cardiac and pulmonary status was stable (without signs of QTc-prolongation, arrhythmia, or tachycardia), state of consciousness improved, so that she could be extubated and was transferred to psychiatric crisis ward within 67 hours after ingestion of quetiapine. The increased levels for glucose and TSH lasted for 2.5 days, CK turned to normal after 6 days and CRP after roughly two weeks, respectively (see ).\nSerum-samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were collected directly on arrival in the emergency department, 5 hours after admission and the following two days (four samples in total). Quetiapine serum concentrations were determined by a validated UV-HPLC-method (linearity range 0.03–4.00 mg\/L, lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) 0.03 mg\/L, limit of detection (LOD) 0.01 mg\/L). Drug concentrations and patient's data (gender, age, weight, height) as well as the ingested amount of quetiapine were processed by a commonly used pharmacokinetic program Mw\/Pharm 3.50 []. Pharmacokinetic parameters were investigated based on an open two-compartment model and a Bayesian fitting procedure.\nElimination half-life was calculated as follows:\n– t\n1\/2 = ln 2\/λ\nz (elimination, λ\nz is the rate constant corresponding to the terminal elimination).\nexemplifies the obtained quetiapine concentration levels and the software generated time-concentration profile based on a two-compartment model (solid-line). In addition, the expected time-concentration profile based on population-pharmacokinetic data is shown (dotted line). Absorption was supposed to be reduced because of anticholinergic effects of quetiapine on intestinal tract.\nThe elimination half-life was t\n1\/2 = 5.3 hours and was calculated based on the four obtained quetiapine concentration levels (c1 = 4.22 mg\/L; c2 = 2.77 mg\/L; c3 = 0.06 mg\/L; c4 = 0.06 mg\/L) with regard to patient's medical records and displayed a moderately increased elimination compared to population pharmacokinetic parameters. Additionally, the absorption rate constant ka (time)−1 had to be adjusted and displayed a reduced absorption of quetiapine after ingestion. In this case the patient was supposed to have ingested 36 g quetiapine corresponding to a dosage of 580 mg\/kg quetiapine. Volume of distribution was within the expected range (Vd = 9 L\/kg based on fitted solid line, ).\nExpected peak quetiapine concentrations for population-pharmacokinetic data were higher than the fitted time-concentration profile based on measured quetiapine concentrations and a two-compartment model.\n\nQuestion: What is the patient's free water deficit in terms of liters? You may take the ideal sodium concentration to be 140 mEq\/L.\n\nAnswer only the requested quantity without units. No explanation needed:",
