        "inputs": "Given a patient note and a clinical question, compute the requested medical value.\n\nPatient note: An 87-year-old lady was admitted to the ENT ward of a district general hospital with brisk, bright red haemoptysis. Subjectively, the patient felt the blood originated in her mouth and denied any coughing or vomiting, although she did complain of a sore throat.\nShe had been suffering intermittent haemoptysis for the past four months and had been investigated by multiple specialists who had not identified the source of the bleeding. She had been seen in ENT clinic, where serial nasendoscopy was normal. An oesophagogastroscopy failed to identify a cause for the bleeding. A subsequent CT of the thorax and abdomen was performed which only showed emphysematous lung changes without identifying a clear source to explain the haemorrhage. She also complained of a spreading, pruritic, blistering rash which had begun three weeks prior to presentation. She was on warfarin for atrial fibrillation, but on admission her INR was within therapeutic range (INR = 2.0).\nOn examination, the patient was seen spitting out bright red blood and a large deroofed blister was observed on the soft palate (). Nasendoscopy revealed normal nasal mucosa and a normal postnasal space. Examination of her abdomen and respiratory systems was normal and there was no calf swelling or tenderness. She was noted to have multiple, annular ulcerated lesions on her back which the patient reported began as pruritic blisters which then ruptured. There were also some intact, tense blisters, overlying erythematous skin predominantly on the groins, but also on the arms, the inner aspect of left thigh, and right shin.\nBlood tests demonstrated the presence of a mild microcytic anaemia and the persistence of a raised urea in keeping with swallowing of blood but were otherwise unremarkable.\nThe patient was subsequently referred to and reviewed by the Dermatology Team on the day of her admission. They felt that given her age and the presence of intact blisters that developed from pruritic lesions, this was clinically in keeping with bullous pemphigoid with mucous membrane involvement. The deroofing of blisters in the oropharynx could account for the intermittent haemoptysis and subsequent raised urea secondary to continuous ingestion of blood. Punch biopsies of perilesional skin were sent for histopathology, which confirmed the diagnosis of bullous pemphigoid, and the patient was commenced on both topical and systemic steroid therapies.\nHistology demonstrated a subepidermal bulla containing fibrin and eosinophils, consistent with bullous pemphigoid (). This diagnosis was supported by direct immunofluorescence, which showed linear homogenous deposition of IgG, C3, and IgA along the basement membrane zone (BMZ). IgM staining was negative. This pattern of linear staining is entirely in keeping with bullous pemphigoid.\nThe patient was commenced on systemic steroids, while awaiting biopsy reports, with prednisolone 30 mg once daily. This was a somewhat conservative dose prescribed in light of her comorbidities including congestive cardiac failure and ischaemic heart disease, compounded by mild anaemia, which at this point in her admission had decompensated to some extent, rendering her breathless. Potent topical steroids were applied to affected areas of skin and a steroid mouthwash was given. A daily blister chart was started to monitor the progress of therapy. Warfarin was withheld until her condition had improved.\nFollowing one week of treatment, the disease activity appeared halted in its progression. After 2 weeks the systemic steroids were gradually tapered: the dose of prednisolone was reduced by 5 mg each week until a dose of 10 mg once daily was reached and thereafter weaned by 1 mg per week. Topical steroids were also reduced in strength gradually and were eventually stopped when no new blisters were reported.\nThe patient was followed up in outpatients clinic for several months, following the cessation of formation of new blisters at discharge. She had continued to complain of a sore mouth and was ultimately treated with a prolonged course of nystatin for oral, and probably oesophageal, candidiasis that occurred secondary to the long course of steroid therapy.\n\nQuestion: What is the patient's CHA2DS2-VASc Score?\n\nAnswer only the requested quantity without units.

        "inputs": "Given a patient note and a clinical question, compute the requested medical value.\n\nPatient note: A 50-year-old female presented with chronic fatigue. The patient was diagnosed with osteoporosis five years prior and was taking alendronate. Hypercalcemia was diagnosed two years following the osteoporosis diagnosis, and the patient visited the hospital for a comprehensive check-up. The patient did not have any history of diabetes, hypertension, tuberculosis, or hepatitis. She was the first daughter of two sons and two daughters. Concurrently, her 81-year-old mother, who was bedridden for unknown reasons, was also undergoing tests for hypercalcemia, and was subsequently diagnosed with multiple parathyroid adenomas and pancreatic tumors, based on the test results. Her father had a history of sudden death by an acute cardiac event.\nIn the neck examination, the thyroid was not enlarged, and palpable tumors were absent. Heart and lung sounds were normal, and no abnormalities were detected in the abdomen, all extremities, or neurological tests. The axillary hair and the pubic hair were normal, hirsutism was absent, and galactorrhea was not observed.\nIn blood electrolyte tests, sodium was 144 mmol\/L, potassium was 4.0 mmol\/L, chloride was 107 mmol\/L, blood calcium was 12.6 mg\/mL, ionized calcium was 5.4 mg\/dL, and inorganic phosphate was 3.3 mg\/dL. In general biochemical tests, fasting blood glucose was 93 mg\/dL, blood urea nitrogen was 8.9 mg\/dL, creatinine was 0.8 mg\/dL, and the hepatic function test was normal. Her 24-hour urinary calcium excretion was 326 mg\/day, the amount of phosphate excretion was 460 mg\/day, and the creatinine clearance rate was 64 mL\/min. Thyroid hormone tests were within normal range, and intact-PTH was increased to 99.8 pg\/mL. Prolactin was also mildly increased to 27.63 ng\/mL. Plasma insulin was 9.2 uIU\/mL (4.2 - 48), gastrin was 21 pg\/mL (0 - 90), glucagon was 40 pg\/mL (40 - 130), pancreatic polypeptide was 79 pmol\/L (< 100), and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide was 32 pg\/mL (< 100). In dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), the T score of the femur was decreased to - 2.0, confirming the osteopenia finding.\nIn the neck ultrasound, in the posterior area of the left thyroid, a tumor suspected to be a parathyroid adenoma 10 mm in size was detected, and in the parathyroid scan, uptake was detected in two glands (). In the neck computed tomography (CT), parathyroid tumors, 10 mm in the left side and 8 mm in the right side, were detected. In the chest CT, abnormal findings in the lung and the mediastinum were not detected. On the brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a tumor 7 mm in size in the pituitary was detected (). On the abdominal MRI, a 2.3 cm left adrenal tumor and a pancreatic tumor were observed, and a 7 cm uterine myoma and a bladder wall myoma were detected (). Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) revealed an esophageal leiomyoma 20 mm in size in the area 20 cm away from the incisor, and in the pancreatic head, a tumor 6 mm in size was detected (). In general positron emission tomography (PET), increased fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in the pituitary was seen. Nonetheless, the increase of the uptake by other lesions was not detected, and thus indicated the benign nature of the multiple tumors.\nFrom the peripheral blood of the patient and her mother, genomic DNA was extracted, and sequencing of the MEN1 gene was performed. Sequencing analysis revealed a transition of GAG to GTG at codon 350 of exon 7, causing an amino acid change from aspartic acid to valine, D350V ().\nBecause of the detection of double parathyroid adenoma, pituitary adenoma, pancreatic tumor, and adrenal cortical tumor, as well as accompanying multiple leiomyomas in the bladder, the uterus, and the esophagus, MEN1 was diagnosed. For parathyroid adenoma, a subtotal parathyroidectomy was performed, leaving half of the left inferior parathyroid gland, and a prophylactic thymectomy was performed as well. In postsurgical histological tests, the diagnosis of parathyroid adenoma was confirmed (). After surgery, the intact-PTH level was decreased to 5.79 pg\/mL. The remaining tumors are under follow up observation.\n\nQuestion: What is the patient's serum osmolality in terms of mOsm\/kg?\n\nAnswer only the requested quantity without units.

        "inputs": "Given a patient note and a clinical question, compute the requested medical value.\n\nPatient note: A 77-year-old woman lost consciousness 6 hours before being admitting to a local clinic where she underwent brain CT. The patient was promptly referred to our department with suspected basal ganglion ICH based on the brain CT. The patient had no medical history other than diabetes. Her premorbid Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score was 3 due to dementia but she had normal cognitive functioning. The patient had stopped taking her diabetic medication 2 months earlier, on her own volition, and had been suffering progressive debilitation. No other symptoms were present. The patient did not take any sedatives or tranquilizers. The initial vital signs were blood pressure 180\/98 mmHg, pulse rate 110\/min, respiratory rate 18\/min, and body temperature 36.8°C. A neurological examination revealed stupor, intact brainstem signs, and greater than grade III motor strength in all four extremities without lateralizing signs. She did not exhibit any abnormal movements of the extremities. No specific abnormalities were found on a systemic physical examination. The initial serum laboratory test results were blood glucose 607 mg\/dL, hemoglobin 12.8 g\/dL, white blood cells 6,720\/mm3, platelets 193,000\/mm3, aspartate aminotransferase 32 IU\/L, alanine aminotransferase 38 IU\/L, blood urea nitrogen 17 mg\/dL, serum creatinine 1.2 mg\/dL, sodium 120 mEq\/L, potassium 5.0 mEq\/L, chloride 89 mEq\/L, serum osmolarity 280 mOsm, and lactate 12.5 mg\/dL. No serum ethanol was detected, and an arterial blood gas analysis revealed the following: pH 7.454, pCO2 37.0 mmHg, pO2 78.1 mmHg, HCO3 25.4 mmol\/L, and base excess 1.6 mmol\/L. No ketones were detected in the urinalysis. Barbiturates, benzodiazepines, and tricyclic antidepressants were not found during a toxin-screening test. The initial brain CT showed a hyperdense lesion in the right basal ganglion (). On magnetic resonance imaging, T1-weighted images revealed high signal intensity indicative of changes due to nonketotic hyperglycemia; diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and an apparent diffusion coefficient map showed restricted diffusion (). Blood glucose level was controlled with regular insulin, and conservative treatment and fluid resuscitation were provided. Electroencephalography revealed findings compatible with diffuse encephalopathy, but no signs of seizure were detected. After admission to the intensive care unit, the patient gradually recovered consciousness and was alert after 24 hours, as blood glucose and sodium were controlled. No abnormal movement disorder was noted after a return to consciousness. The patient was discharged 10 days after admission without any complications.\n\nQuestion: What is the patient's serum osmolality in terms of mOsm\/kg?\n\nAnswer only the requested quantity without units.
