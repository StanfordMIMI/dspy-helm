initial voice networks continue to be deployed in underdeveloped areas .\na majority of consumers in these markets still utilize basic wireless services , predominantly on feature phones , while advanced device penetration remains low .\nin more developed urban locations within these markets , early-stage data network deployments are underway .\ncarriers are focused on completing voice network build-outs while also investing in initial data networks as wireless data usage and smartphone penetration within their customer bases begin to accelerate .\nin markets with rapidly evolving network technology , such as south africa and most of the countries in latin america where we do business , initial voice networks , for the most part , have already been built out , and carriers are focused on 3g and 4g network build outs .\nconsumers in these regions are increasingly adopting smartphones and other advanced devices , and , as a result , the usage of bandwidth-intensive mobile applications is growing materially .\nrecent spectrum auctions in these rapidly evolving markets have allowed incumbent carriers to accelerate their data network deployments and have also enabled new entrants to begin initial investments in data networks .\nsmartphone penetration and wireless data usage in these markets are growing rapidly , which typically requires that carriers continue to invest in their networks in order to maintain and augment their quality of service .\nfinally , in markets with more mature network technology , such as germany and france , carriers are focused on deploying 4g data networks to account for rapidly increasing wireless data usage among their customer base .\nwith higher smartphone and advanced device penetration and significantly higher per capita data usage , carrier investment in networks is focused on 4g coverage and capacity .\nwe believe that the network technology migration we have seen in the united states , which has led to significantly denser networks and meaningful new business commencements for us over a number of years , will ultimately be replicated in our less advanced international markets .\nas a result , we expect to be able to leverage our extensive international portfolio of approximately 104470 communications sites and the relationships we have built with our carrier customers to drive sustainable , long-term growth .\nwe have master lease agreements with certain of our tenants that provide for consistent , long-term revenue and reduce the likelihood of churn .\nour master lease agreements build

construction of approximately 45310 sites .\nin a majority of our asia , emea and latin america markets , the revenue generated from newly acquired or constructed sites resulted in increases in both tenant and pass-through revenues ( such as ground rent or power and fuel costs ) and expenses .\nwe continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire communications real estate portfolios , both
