benefits that , if recognized , would affect the effective tax rate was $ 134 million .\nwe also had gross recognized tax benefits of $ 567 million recorded as of december 31 , 2007 associated with outstanding refund claims for prior tax years .\ntherefore , we had a net receivable recorded with respect to prior year income tax matters in the accompanying balance sheets .\nour continuing practice is to recognize interest and penalties associated with income tax matters as a component of income tax expense .\nrelated to the uncertain tax benefits noted above , we accrued penalties of $ 5 million and interest of $ 36 million during 2007 .\nas of december 31 , 2007 , we have recognized a liability for penalties of $ 6 million and interest of $ 75 million .\nadditionally , we have recognized a receivable for interest of $ 116 million for the recognized tax benefits associated with outstanding refund claims .\nwe file income tax returns in the u.s .\nfederal jurisdiction , most u.s .\nstate and local jurisdictions , and many non-u.s .\njurisdictions .\nas of december 31 , 2007 , we had substantially resolved all u.s .\nfederal income tax matters for tax years prior to 1999 .\nin the third quarter of 2007 , we entered into a joint stipulation to dismiss the case with the department of justice , effectively withdrawing our refund claim related to the 1994 disposition of a subsidiary in france .\nthe write-off of previously recognized tax receivable balances associated with the 1994 french matter resulted in a $ 37 million increase in income tax expense for the quarter

include the timing of interest deductions , the deductibility of acquisition costs , the consideration of filing requirements in various states , the allocation of income and expense between tax jurisdictions and the effects of terminating an election to have a foreign subsidiary join in filing a consolidated return .\nthese changes could result from the settlement of ongoing litigation , the
