        "reasoning": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the sentence and fill in the blanks logically with the given context and choices:\n\n1. The first blank contrasts two concepts related to consumer campaigns. Typically, a boycott is a form of protest where consumers abstain from purchasing from certain companies to express dissatisfaction with their behavior. In contrast, a \"buycott\" is aimed at rewarding companies for favorable behavior by encouraging purchasing their products. Thus, the first correct pairing is: \"In contrast to boycotts, buycotts...\"\n\n2. The second blank refers to what enhances the success of such campaigns. \"Digital technology\" is a general term that makes sense as it can be broadly applicable to campaigns, helping them reach more people and facilitate easier transactions, information dissemination, etc.\n\n3. The third blank refers to what campaigns aim to help companies achieve. Campaigns that reward favorable behavior likely aim to increase sales, as they encourage more people to buy from the company.\n\nThis analysis points toward the answer choice that correctly completes the sentence as: \"In contrast to boycotts, buycotts aim to reward favorable behavior by companies. The success of such campaigns has been heightened through the use of digital technology, which allow campaigns to facilitate the company in achieving increased sales.\"\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be:\n\nThe correct answer is F: Boycotts, Buycotts, Digital technology, Increased Sales.",

        "reasoning": "To generate the target code for the expression `G := (A + B) * C - (D + E) * F` using a single accumulator, we have to break down the expression into smaller parts that can be computed sequentially using the available instructions: load, store, add, subtract, and multiply. Below are the steps to compute the expression with the minimal number of instructions:\n\n1. Compute the value of `A + B` and store it in a temporary location.\n   - `LOAD A`       (accumulator = A)\n   - `ADD B`        (accumulator = A + B)\n   - `STORE TEMP1`  (store A + B in TEMP1)\n\n2. Multiply the result of step 1 with `C`.\n   - `LOAD TEMP1`   (accumulator = A + B)\n   - `MULTIPLY C`   (accumulator = (A + B) * C)\n   - `STORE TEMP2`  (store (A + B) * C in TEMP2)\n\n3. Compute the value of `D + E` and store it in another temporary location.\n   - `LOAD D`       (accumulator = D)\n   - `ADD E`        (accumulator = D + E)\n   - `STORE TEMP3`  (store D + E in TEMP3)\n\n4. Multiply the result of step 3 with `F`.\n   - `LOAD TEMP3`   (accumulator = D + E)\n   - `MULTIPLY F`   (accumulator = (D + E) * F)\n   - `STORE TEMP4`  (store (D + E) * F in TEMP4)\n\n5. Subtract the second multiplication result from the first multiplication result to get the final result to store in `G`.\n   - `LOAD TEMP2`   (accumulator = (A + B) * C)\n   - `SUBTRACT TEMP4` (accumulator = (A + B) * C - (D + E) * F)\n   - `STORE G`      (store result in G)\n\nLet's count these instructions:\n- 3 instructions for computing and storing `A + B`\n- 3 instructions for multiplying with `C` and storing\n- 3 instructions for computing and storing `D + E`\n- 3 instructions for multiplying with `F` and storing\n- 3 instructions for final subtraction and storing result in G\n\nIn total, we have:\n3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 15 instructions.\n\nHowever, we can try to minimize some of the steps:\n1. Load and compute each operation only as needed without extra stores (minimize store instructions).\n2. We can further optimize by realizing that storing intermediate results isn’t always necessary if they’re used immediately after their computation.\n\nCounting the necessary load, operate, and store instructions in the optimal way (still combining operations smartly):\n\n- `LOAD A` (1)\n- `ADD B` (1)\n- `MULTIPLY C` (1)\n- `STORE TEMP` (1)\n- `LOAD D` (1)\n- `ADD E` (1)\n- `MULTIPLY F` (1)\n- `SUBTRACT TEMP` (1)\n- `STORE G` (1)\n\nNow it's:\n1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 9 instructions.\n\nTherefore, the minimal number of instructions is 9.",
