        "reasoning": "To answer this question, we need to consider the focus of Pascale's interest, which is the processing strategies children use to learn new information. This focus indicates an emphasis on how children develop and learn, which falls under the umbrella of developmental psychology. Developmental psychology is concerned with the study of human development across the lifespan, including cognitive, social, and emotional development. Since Pascale is specifically interested in how children process new information, this aligns with the cognitive aspect of developmental psychology. However, the key term here is \"developmental\" because it directly relates to the study of development across the lifespan, particularly in children.",
