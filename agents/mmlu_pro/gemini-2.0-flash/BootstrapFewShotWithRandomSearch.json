        "reasoning": "Short-period comets are believed to originate from the Kuiper Belt. The Kuiper Belt is a region beyond Neptune's orbit that contains icy bodies. Short-period comets have orbital periods of less than 200 years and their orbits tend to lie in the plane of the solar system, similar to the objects in the Kuiper Belt. The Oort cloud is a spherical cloud much further out and is the source of long-period comets. The asteroid belt is located between Mars and Jupiter and is primarily composed of rocky and metallic objects, not icy ones.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.",
