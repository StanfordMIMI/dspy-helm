It presents arterial pressure of 185\/85 mm Hg and purple lesions on the toes of both feet. In the analytical, urea 230 mg \/ dL and creatinine 5.8 mg \/ dL were observed. What is the most likely diagnosis?\nA. Malignant arterial hypertension.\nB. Acute tubular necrosis by contrast.\nC. Rapidly progressive renal failure.\nD. Renal atheroembolic disease.\nE. Bilateral renal artery stenosis.\nAnswer:",
        "reasoning": "The patient is an elderly man who recently underwent a cardiac catheterization with revascularization. Three weeks later, he presents with nausea, vomiting, a significant rise in urea and creatinine, and purple lesions on his toesâ€”a description consistent with a \"blue toe\" syndrome. This constellation of findings strongly suggests renal atheroembolic disease (cholesterol embolization syndrome), which occurs when cholesterol plaques from atherosclerotic vessels embolize following manipulation (such as catheterization), leading to both renal failure and cutaneous manifestations. The timeline (three weeks) further supports this diagnosis compared to contrast-induced acute tubular necrosis, which typically presents sooner.",
