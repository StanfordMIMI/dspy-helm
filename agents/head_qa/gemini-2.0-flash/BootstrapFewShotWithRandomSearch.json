        "reasoning": "The Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) model predicts the geometry of molecules based on minimizing electron pair repulsion.\n\n*   **A. The AB2 molecules are always linear.** This is incorrect. AB2 molecules can be bent if the central atom has lone pairs (e.g., SO2).\n*   **B. The AB6 molecules are always octahedral.** This is generally true. AB6 molecules with no lone pairs on the central atom adopt an octahedral geometry to minimize repulsion.\n*   **C. The AB3 molecules are always triangular.** This is incorrect. AB3 molecules can be trigonal planar (e.g., BF3) or trigonal pyramidal (e.g., NH3) depending on whether there are lone pairs on the central atom.\n*   **D. The AB4 molecules are always tetrahedral.** This is incorrect. AB4 molecules can be tetrahedral (e.g., CH4) or square planar (e.g., XeF4) or see-saw (e.g., SF4) depending on whether there are lone pairs on the central atom.\n*   **E. The AB5 molecules are always trigonal bipyramidal.** This is incorrect. AB5 molecules can be trigonal bipyramidal (e.g., PCl5) or square pyramidal (e.g., BrF5) depending on whether there are lone pairs on the central atom.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement is that AB6 molecules are always octahedral.",
