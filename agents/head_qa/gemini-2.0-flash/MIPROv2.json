It presents arterial pressure of 185\/85 mm Hg and purple lesions on the toes of both feet. In the analytical, urea 230 mg \/ dL and creatinine 5.8 mg \/ dL were observed. What is the most likely diagnosis?\nA. Malignant arterial hypertension.\nB. Acute tubular necrosis by contrast.\nC. Rapidly progressive renal failure.\nD. Renal atheroembolic disease.\nE. Bilateral renal artery stenosis.\nAnswer:",
        "reasoning": "The patient's presentation includes recent cardiac catheterization with revascularization, hypertension, nausea, vomiting, elevated urea and creatinine, and purple lesions on the toes. These findings strongly suggest renal atheroembolic disease. The recent cardiac catheterization is a risk factor for atheroemboli dislodging and traveling to the kidneys. The elevated urea and creatinine indicate renal dysfunction. The purple lesions on the toes (livedo reticularis or \"trash toes\") are characteristic of atheroemboli lodging in small vessels. While acute tubular necrosis by contrast is possible, the presence of the toe lesions makes atheroembolic disease more likely. Malignant hypertension could cause renal damage, but the toe lesions are not typical. Rapidly progressive renal failure is a general term and doesn't explain the specific findings. Bilateral renal artery stenosis could cause hypertension and renal dysfunction, but the toe lesions are not typical.",
