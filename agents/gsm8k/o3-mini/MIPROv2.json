        "reasoning": "First, we calculate the area of the rectangular patch: 6 inches × 7 inches = 42 square inches. Next, we calculate the area of the square path: 5 inches × 5 inches = 25 square inches. The total area that needs to be filled with sand is 42 + 25 = 67 square inches. Since it takes 3 grams of sand to fill one square inch, Jason needs 67 × 3 = 201 grams of sand.",

Given the narrative problem as `inputs`, generate a detailed step-by-step `reasoning` that leads to the final `output`, which is the solution. Apply critical thinking and precise arithmetic operations to ensure that the solution is accurate and easy for the student to follow. Your goal is to empower the student with a clear comprehension of how these problems are solved.
