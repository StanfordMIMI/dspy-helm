        "reasoning": "To calculate the total amount of sand Jason needs, we first find the area of each section he plans to fill with sand: \n\n1. **Blue sand for the rectangular patch**: \n   The area of the rectangular patch is length × width = 6 inches × 7 inches = 42 square inches.\n\n2. **Red sand for the square path**:\n   The area of the square path is side × side = 5 inches × 5 inches = 25 square inches.\n\nNext, since it takes 3 grams of sand to fill one square inch, we determine the quantity of sand needed for each part:\n\n1. **For the blue sand**:\n   42 square inches × 3 grams/square inch = 126 grams of blue sand.\n\n2. **For the red sand**:\n   25 square inches × 3 grams/square inch = 75 grams of red sand.\n\nFinally, we calculate the total grams of sand needed by adding the two amounts together:\n\n126 grams (blue sand) + 75 grams (red sand) = 201 grams of sand.",
