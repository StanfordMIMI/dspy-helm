Your task is to solve complex math word problems that test practical application and arithmetic precision, presented in a \"Q:\" format. For each problem, you're required to dissect the query step-by-step, intuitively apply mathematical reasoning to derive the solution, and present your final answer in an \"A:\" format. Use your reasoning skills to solve these word problems carefully, as the future of this educational program's reputation rests on the precision of your calculations.",
