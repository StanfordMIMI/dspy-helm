You will be provided with a clinical scenario followed by several multiple-choice options.\n\nSelect the correct answer by outputting only the letter corresponding to your choice (A, B, C, D, or E).\n\nClinical Scenario: A 53-year-old African-American woman presents to her primary care doctor with increasing difficulty climbing the stairs. She noticed the weakness approximately 3 months ago. It has gotten progressively worse since that time. She has also noticed increasing difficulty combing her hair, standing from a seated position, and experiences muscle aches. Her medical history is significant for hypertension treated with lifestyle modification and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Her temperature is 98.6°F (37.0°C), blood pressure is 130\/65 mmHg, pulse is 80\/min, and respirations are 16\/min. She has 3\/5 strength to shoulder abduction and hip flexion bilaterally. Her strength is 5\/5 to wrist extension and ankle plantar flexion. No skin rashes are noted. Which of the following is the most accurate test to confirm this patient’s diagnosis?\nA. Serum creatine kinase\nB. Muscle biopsy\nC. Electromyography\nD. Serum aldolase\nAnswer:",
        "reasoning": "The clinical scenario describes a 53-year-old woman with progressive proximal muscle weakness, which is characteristic of a myopathy. The weakness in shoulder abduction and hip flexion, along with difficulty climbing stairs and combing hair, suggests a proximal muscle involvement. The absence of skin rashes makes dermatomyositis less likely, pointing towards polymyositis or another form of myopathy.\n\nTo confirm the diagnosis of polymyositis, the most accurate test is a muscle biopsy. A muscle biopsy can reveal inflammatory infiltrates and other histopathological changes that are characteristic of polymyositis, making it the definitive test for diagnosis. While serum creatine kinase and aldolase levels can be elevated in myopathies, they are not specific and do not confirm the diagnosis. Electromyography can show myopathic changes but is also not definitive.",

You will be provided with a clinical scenario followed by several multiple-choice options.\n\nSelect the correct answer by outputting only the letter corresponding to your choice (A, B, C, D, or E).\n\nClinical Scenario: A 44-year-old homeless man presents to the emergency department after being stabbed multiple times in the abdomen. The patient is intoxicated and is unable to offer further history. His temperature is 97.5°F (36.4°C), blood pressure is 92\/52 mmHg, pulse is 145\/min, respirations are 33\/min, and oxygen saturation is 90% on room air. He is intubated to protect his airway, given 2 units of packed red blood cells, and sent to the operating room for an exploratory laparotomy. The patient is subsequently admitted to the intensive care unit. He is extubated the next day and appears well. His vitals are within normal limits. Physical exam reveals sparse hair that is falling out throughout the patient’s body. He has a rash by the corners of his mouth. The patient has multiple loose bowel movements and on day 6 the patient’s surgical wound does not appear to be healing. It is held together only by the sutures with minimal underlying healing. Which of the following is most likely deficient in this patient?\nA. Thiamine\nB. Vitamin C\nC. Zinc\nD. Riboflavin\nAnswer:",
        "reasoning": "The clinical scenario describes a patient with poor wound healing, a rash at the corners of the mouth, and sparse hair that is falling out. These symptoms are indicative of a zinc deficiency. Zinc is an essential trace element that plays a crucial role in immune function, protein synthesis, wound healing, DNA synthesis, and cell division. Zinc deficiency can lead to poor wound healing, alopecia (hair loss), and dermatitis, particularly around body orifices such as the mouth. The patient's homelessness and poor nutritional status likely contribute to this deficiency.",

He was walking in the park about 45 minutes prior to arrival when the patient stumbled and fell. He had sudden weakness in his left leg and was unable to grasp a handrail with his left hand. He currently takes no medications. His temperature is 98.0°F (36.6°C), blood pressure is 128\/89 mmHg, pulse is 130\/min, and respirations are 18\/min. On exam, he has 3\/5 strength in the left upper and lower extremities and a left-sided facial droop. A non-contrast CT scan of the head is performed, which suggests parenchymal ischemia in the distribution of the right middle cerebral artery. An ECG is performed, as shown in Figure A. He is given intravenous alteplase with rapid improvement in his strength deficits and facial asymmetry.
