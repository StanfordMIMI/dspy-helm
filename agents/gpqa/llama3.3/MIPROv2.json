        "reasoning": "To determine which of the particles listed is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry, let's consider what each particle represents and the concept of spontaneous symmetry breaking.\n\nSpontaneous symmetry breaking occurs when a system's ground state does not exhibit the same symmetries as the system's equations of motion. This phenomenon is crucial in particle physics, particularly in the context of the Standard Model, where it explains how particles acquire mass.\n\n(A) Pion: Pions are associated with the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). Chiral symmetry is an approximate symmetry of QCD that is spontaneously broken, leading to the emergence of pions as Goldstone bosons.\n\n(B) Phonon: Phonons are quanta of sound waves in solids and are associated with the breaking of translational symmetry. In a solid, the continuous translational symmetry of the free space is broken down to a discrete translational symmetry, giving rise to phonons.\n\n(C) Magnon: Magnons are quanta of spin waves in magnets and are related to the breaking of rotational symmetry in the spin space. When a magnet orders, the rotational symmetry in the spin space is spontaneously broken, leading to the existence of magnons.\n\n(D) Skyrmion: Skyrmions are topological objects that can be found in various systems, including magnetic materials and nuclei. They are related to the topology of the system rather than a spontaneous symmetry breaking in the traditional sense used for the other particles. Skyrmions can be thought of as stable, particle-like configurations that arise from the non-trivial topology of the order parameter space, rather than directly from a spontaneously broken symmetry.\n\nGiven the above explanations, Skyrmions stand out as they are more about topological configurations rather than direct manifestations of spontaneously broken symmetries like the other particles.",

When the star's surface is not covered by dark spots, its Teff is 6000K. However, when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. In the stellar photosphere, when examining the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2), astronomers have observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. What is the factor by which this ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots? Note that the transition between the energy levels under consideration corresponds to a wavelength of approximately 1448 Å. Assume that the stellar photosphere is in LTE. \n\nChoices: \n(A) ~1.1\n(B) ~7.8\n(C) ~4.5\n(D) ~2.9 \nLet’s think step by step.
