        "reasoning": "The reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in liquid ammonia is a benzyne reaction. The strong base NaNH2 will deprotonate the carbon adjacent to the carbon bearing the bromine. Since there is deuterium at the 2-position, deprotonation can occur at either the 2-position (removing deuterium) or the 6-position (removing hydrogen). This forms a benzyne intermediate. The benzyne intermediate can then be protonated (or deuterated) by the ammonia solvent.\n\nIf deprotonation occurs at the 2-position, the benzyne intermediate will have a deuterium at the position where the triple bond is. Addition of NH3 can occur at either carbon of the triple bond. If NH3 adds to the carbon that originally had the deuterium, the product will be aniline. If NH3 adds to the other carbon, the product will be aniline-2-d.\n\nIf deprotonation occurs at the 6-position, the benzyne intermediate will have a deuterium at the 1-position. Addition of NH3 can occur at either carbon of the triple bond. If NH3 adds to the carbon that originally had the bromine, the product will be aniline-3-d. If NH3 adds to the other carbon, the product will be aniline.\n\nTherefore, the possible products are aniline, aniline-2-d, and aniline-3-d.",

        "reasoning": "The question asks when the gravitational force of the planet dominates over the centrifugal force. Since the objects are orbiting the planet, we need to compare the gravitational force of the planet on the object to the centrifugal force acting on the object due to its orbit around the planet. However, the question is simplified by asking when the gravitational force of the planet exceeds the centrifugal force, which is equivalent to asking when the object is gravitationally bound to the planet. We can determine this by comparing the gravitational force between the planet and the object to the gravitational force between the star and the object. However, since the objects are close to the planet, we can approximate this by simply comparing the gravitational force between the planet and the object.\n\nThe gravitational force between two objects is given by $F = G \\frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}$, where $G$ is the gravitational constant, $m_1$ and $m_2$ are the masses of the two objects, and $r$ is the distance between them. We want to find the cases where the gravitational force of the planet on the object is significant. Since $G$ is constant, we can compare the ratio $\\frac{m_{object}}{r^2}$ for each case. The planet has a mass of 2 Earth masses.\n\na) $\\frac{0.002}{(0.012)^2} = \\frac{0.002}{0.000144} \\approx 13.89$\nb) $\\frac{0.006}{(0.014)^2} = \\frac{0.006}{0.000196} \\approx 30.61$\nc) $\\frac{0.001}{(0.019)^2} = \\frac{0.001}{0.000361} \\approx 2.77$\nd) $\\frac{0.003}{(0.021)^2} = \\frac{0.003}{0.000441} \\approx 6.80$\n\nWe are looking for the cases where the gravitational force of the planet dominates. Since the planet's mass is 2 Earth masses, we should multiply the above ratios by 2 to get a better comparison.\na) $2 \\times 13.89 \\approx 27.78$\nb) $2 \\times 30.61 \\approx 61.22$\nc) $2 \\times 2.77 \\approx 5.54$\nd) $2 \\times 6.80 \\approx 13.60$\n\nComparing the values, a and b have the largest values, suggesting that the gravitational force of the planet is more significant in these cases.
