        "inputs": "What is the correct answer to this question: Two stars are being studied. It has been observed that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2. In fact, the energy difference between the considered energy levels was determined to be approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J. Assuming that the stellar photospheres are in LTE, which of these equations for the effective temperatures of the stars (T_1 and T_2) is correct? \n\nChoices: \n(A) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ]\n(B) ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n(C) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n(D) ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1] \nLet’s think step by step. Based on your reasoning, what is the single, most likely answer choice?

        "reasoning": "Since the two stars are in LTE, the number of atoms in a specific excited energy level is given by the Boltzmann factor. That is, for a given level with energy difference ΔE, the fraction in that level is proportional to exp(–ΔE/(kT)). For star₁ and star₂, the ratio of excited atoms is given by\n  exp(–ΔE/(kT₁)) / exp(–ΔE/(kT₂)) = exp[–ΔE/k (1/T₁ – 1/T₂)].\nWe are told that iron atoms in star₁ are twice as excited as in star₂:\n  2 = exp[–ΔE/k (1/T₁ – 1/T₂)].\nTaking natural logarithms of both sides gives:\n  ln(2) = –ΔE/k (1/T₁ – 1/T₂) = ΔE/k (1/T₂ – 1/T₁).\nNow, note that the energy difference is given as approximately 1.38×10^(–23) J, which is numerically close to the Boltzmann constant k (1.38×10^(–23) J/K). Therefore, ΔE/k ≈ 1 K, and the equation becomes:\n  ln(2) = 1/T₂ – 1/T₁.\nRearranging the difference in reciprocals:\n  1/T₂ – 1/T₁ = (T₁ – T₂)/(T₁T₂).\nThus the equation simplifies to:\n  ln(2) = (T₁ – T₂)/(T₁T₂).\nComparing with the provided options, this corresponds exactly to choice (C).",
