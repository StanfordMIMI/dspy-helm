        "reasoning": "A pion is the Goldstone boson associated with the spontaneously broken approximate chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics. A phonon can be regarded as the Goldstone boson resulting from the spontaneous breaking of continuous translation symmetry in a crystal lattice. A magnon is the effective excitation emerging from the spontaneous breaking of spin rotational symmetry, as seen in magnets. In contrast, a skyrmion is a topologically stable soliton that does not arise as a Goldstone mode of a spontaneously-broken symmetry but rather from the topology of the field configuration itself.",

When the star's surface is not covered by dark spots, its Teff is 6000K. However, when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. In the stellar photosphere, when examining the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2), astronomers have observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. What is the factor by which this ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots? Note that the transition between the energy levels under consideration corresponds to a wavelength of approximately 1448 Å. Assume that the stellar photosphere is in LTE. \n\nChoices: \n(A) ~1.1\n(B) ~7.8\n(C) ~4.5\n(D) ~2.9 \nLet’s think step by step.
